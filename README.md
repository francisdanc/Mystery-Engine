# Introduction 
I've always enjoyed the mystery genre, theres something about solving a mystery that is really satisfying to me. I remember as a kid playing the Professor Layton series by nintendo and enjoying racking my brain trying to solve puzzles all the while trying to figure out the mystery that drove the story or reading every book in Anthony Horrowitz, Diamond Brothers Detective Agency book series. I thought to myself recently that i'd enjoy a mystery game in which I could really feel like a detective, in which i question suspects, try and figure out motives and piece together a story of what happened. I've come to find that no such game exists, there are some that come close but they ultimately fall short and become repetetive or dont require any real aspects of what appeals to me about the detective genre such as motive and character. 

# Original Idea
This need for a detective experience led to the idea of the Mystery Engine! The Mystery Engine will take as a set of inputs Location and Characters with each character having a name and an occupation. Given these inputs the Mystery Engine (I will go into depth about proposed methodology later) will generate a mystery story in which there is a victim, a culprit, a method of murder and a motive all within a set location. The user will then be able to question characters about the event that took place and inspect the crime scene in order to piece together a story and hopefully arrest the correct suspect.
